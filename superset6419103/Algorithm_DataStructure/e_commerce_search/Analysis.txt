For Linear Search: O(n)
Good for small datasets or when list is unsorted.

For Binary Search: O(log n)
Much faster, but requires the list to be sorted.

If the product list is frequently changing (insertions, deletions), linear search can be acceptable.
But for the large, mostly static datasets where performance matters, binary search is preferred due to log(n) time.
